<h1>Mathematical Model of Market Dynamics</h1>
<p><strong>12/10/2024</strong></p>
<p>I did this project as part of my mathematical modeling class (Math 456) to study the dynamics between cryptocurrency markets and traditional financial markets.
    I used the S&amp;P 500 as a general indicator of traditional markets and constructed a cryptocurrency index from the top 23 cryptocurrencies.
    I also created an additional data series to represent capital not in either market but able to flow in or out.
</p>
<p><strong>Markov Chain Model</strong></p>
<p>
Let A represent the S&amp;P 500, B the Cryptocurrency Market, and C all external markets and capital. The Markov chain transition matrix P, representing the probabilities of transitioning between the three markets, is defined as:
</p>
<pre><code>P = [ P_AA  P_AB  P_AC ]
    [ P_BA  P_BB  P_BC ]
    [ P_CA  P_CB  P_CC ]
</code></pre>
<p>
Each row represents the probabilities of transitioning from one market to another, 
with rows summing to 1. The goal is to estimate P such that PX = Y, where X and Y are 
vectors of market states at consecutive time steps. To solve for P, the dataset was 
interpolated to increase the number of data points, allowing for a least-squares 
estimation of P under constraints 0 &lt; P_ij &lt; 1.
</p>
<p>
The resulting transition matrices were analyzed and visualized, 
but the complexity of capital flow was difficult to capture with a 
simple probability transition matrix.
</p>

<p><strong>Modified Lotka-Volterra Model</strong></p>
<p>
The Lotka-Volterra model describes predator-prey dynamics and 
was adapted to model the interaction between traditional and cryptocurrency markets. 
The traditional model equations are:
</p>
<pre><code>dA/dt = αA - βAB
dB/dt = δAB - γB
</code></pre>
<p>
where A and B are the market indices, and α, β, δ, γ are parameters. 
To account for external effects, a new parameter k was introduced:
</p>
<pre><code>dA/dt = αA - βAB + k(2 - (A + B))
dB/dt = δAB - γB - k(2 - (A + B))
</code></pre>
<p>
The model parameters were fitted to observed data by minimizing 
the sum of squared errors. Both the traditional and modified models 
were compared across different date ranges. The modified model often 
provided a better fit, especially over longer time horizons, due to its 
flexibility in accounting for external influences.
</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Formulated mathematical models (Markov Chains, Lotka-Volterra) to study interactions between cryptocurrency 
    markets and traditional financial markets. </li>
<li>Proposed a Modified Lotka-Volterra model, achieving a 99.9% reduction in Mean Squared Error over a traditional 
    Lotka-Volterra model. </li>
<li>Utilized machine learning and optimization techniques for parameter fitting and validation of 
    dynamic models. </li>
</ul>
