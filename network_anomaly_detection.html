<h1>Network Traffic Anomaly Detection</h1>
<p><strong>07/09/2025</strong></p>


<p>I did this project to compare the effectiveness of anomaly detection in network traffic between supervised and unsupervised learning. The dataset used is CICIDS2017, a dataset from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Supervised Learning vs. Unsupervised Learning</strong></p>

<p>For supervised learning, I decided to use Random Forest because it can handle non-linear 
    relationships and is relatively easy to implement. XGBoost is another supervised learning model 
    that uses decision trees but in a different way, and is apparently slightly better than Random Forest.
     XGBoost requires more hyperparameter tuning, but I didn't do that in this project because it took too long
     to run when I tried.
</p>
<p>
    For unsupervised learning, I decided to use Isolation Forest because it is made for anomaly detection. Instead of learning a profile of normal data,
     it tries to isolate anomalies. I used Autoencoder because I learned about it in one of my recent classes and I
    wanted to try it out.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Developed and compared <strong>supervised </strong>(Random Forest, XGBoost) and <strong>unsupervised </strong>(Isolation Forest, Autoencoder) models to detect anomalies in network traffic using the CICIDS2017 dataset.</li>
<li>Achieved <strong>96.69% AUC</strong> with XGBoost and <strong>87.14% AUC</strong> with Autoencoder by engineering flow-based network features and performing time-series traffic analysis.</li>
<li>Visualized model performance using <strong>ROC curves, confusion matrices, and t-SNE clustering.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Used: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn</em></p>
